= Schemeless

Inspired by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1758[SOLR-1758], Schemeless enables us to validate Solr schema files seamlessly using built-in rules based on past experiences. Feel free to contribute to support more schema rules.

== How to get started

To build and run the Schemeless tool, follow these steps:

[bash]
----
$ cargo build
$ cargo run -- examples/managed-schema.xml
----

Alternatively, prepare it as a CLI command:

[bash]
----
$ cargo build --release
$ target/release/schemeless examples/managed-schema.xml
----
